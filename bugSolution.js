The solution involves a systematic approach to debugging.  The `bug.js` file (which would contain a typical app.js) is not directly relevant; the issue lies in the underlying Android build process.

The provided solution focuses on debugging strategies:

1. **Clean the project:**
```bash
expo prebuild
expo run:android --clear
```

2. **Check for Gradle version conflicts:**
   Examine the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files for Gradle version definitions.  Ensure compatibility with your Expo SDK version.

3. **Analyze the complete build log:**
   The full build log, often quite long, will contain clues about the specific resource issue. Search carefully for details on the failing resource or any errors relating to resources (images, layouts, etc.).

4. **Inspect Android Resource Files:**
   Manually check images, XML layouts, and other resource files for issues like incorrect naming, missing files, or format problems.

5. **Check for conflicting dependencies:**
   Run `expo diagnostics` and examine the output.  Then examine your package.json and consider using `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze your dependency tree for potential version conflicts that might cause resource loading problems.
