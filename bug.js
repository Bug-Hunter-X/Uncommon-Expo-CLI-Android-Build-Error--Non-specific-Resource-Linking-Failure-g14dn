This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with an error message similar to: 
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
...
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade
   > Android resource linking failed
     ...
```
The error message is not specific enough to pinpoint the cause, and the build log is quite long and hard to navigate. This makes it difficult to debug and resolve the issue.

This is a fairly uncommon error, as it is not consistently reproducible and can be caused by a variety of factors.  For example, it may be related to issues with the Android SDK, Gradle version mismatch, conflicting dependencies, or problems with the project's resources (images, layouts, etc.).
